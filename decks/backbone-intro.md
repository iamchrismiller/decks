## Backbone

> Backbone.js gives structure to web applications by providing **models**
> with key-value binding and custom events, **collections** with a rich API
> of enumerable functions, **views** with declarative event handling, and
> connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface.

## Backbone is *not* MVC

- ### Models
- ### Views
- ### *Collections* (not Controllers)
---
## Backbone is mostly convention

- ### Does not force your hand
  There are a lot of established patterns, but you are free to find your way
- ### Sets up a lot you would want to do anyway
  Event binding, event bubbling, collection enumeration
- ### Most bang for your buck
  Stuff, Lists of Stuff, and Showing stuff is core to any application. Backbone strengthens your core.
